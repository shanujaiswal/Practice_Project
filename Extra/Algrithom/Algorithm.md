## Algorithm && Program

==> Algorithm

1. Algorithm: The conceptual solution, independent of programming language
2. Design: Planning the structure and approach of the solution
3. Domain Knowledge: Understanding the specific field (finance, healthcare, etc.)
4. Any Language: Can be expressed in any formal notation or natural language
5. Hardware and Operating System: Generally independent of specific technology
6. Analyzing: Evaluating the efficiency, correctness, and complexity of the solution

==> Program

1. Program: The concrete implementation of an algorithm
2. Implementation: The actual coding and building process
3. Programming Knowledge: Understanding syntax, language features, and coding patterns
4. Programming Language: Must use a specific language (Python, Java, C++, etc.)
5. Hardware and Operating System: Must account for specific technology constraints
6. Testing: Verifying the program works correctly through unit tests, integration tests, etc.

## Algorithm vs. Programming

--> An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem, while programming is the process of writing code to implement those algorithms

## Priori Analysis (Algorithms) && Posteriori Testing (Programs)

==> Priori Analysis (Algorithms)
--> Algorithm: The theoretical approach to problem-solving
--> Independent of Language: Can be expressed in any notation or natural language
--> Hardware Independent: Conceptually separate from physical implementation
--> Time & Space Function: Analyzed theoretically using Big O notation for efficiency

==> Posteriori Testing (Programs)
--> Program: The concrete implementation
--> Language dependent: Tied to a specific programming language
--> Hardware dependent: Performance affected by the physical computing environment
--> Watch time & Bytes: Measured empirically during execution

==> This comparison highlights the fundamental distinction in how we evaluate solutions:
--> Priori Analysis: Theoretical evaluation before implementation (analyzing "on paper")
--> Posteriori Testing: Practical evaluation after implementation (measuring actual performance)

# Characteristics of an algorithm

--> Input – An algorithm can have zero or more inputs. These are the values supplied externally to the algorithm.

--> Output – It should produce at least one output. The result or outcome of the algorithm must be well-defined.

--> Definiteness – Every step of the algorithm must be clearly and unambiguously defined.

--> Finiteness – The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps. It should not run indefinitely.

--> Effectiveness – All operations must be basic enough to be performed, in principle, by a person using only paper and pencil in a finite amount of time.
