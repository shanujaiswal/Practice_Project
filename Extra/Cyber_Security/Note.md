3. For little work there is often high returns
4. Attackers can target thousands of victims
5. Money laundering is easier with Cryptocurrencies

--> The Internet offers many services to facilitate money laundering, usually making it a trivial process. As money is exchanged in cryptocurrency, services such as tumblers make it hard to track the money.
--> Tumblers are services which split up cryptocurrency transactions and forward the money through many accounts, with different values, for thousands of people, making them hard to track.

State-sponsored groups targeting organizations in other countries
Hacking Groups out to target companies to make them pay ransom
