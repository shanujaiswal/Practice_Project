Switch Statement
--> evaluates a value against multiple cases and executes the code block of the matching case
-->  Provide break if you want to stop the execution and no further responses from code otherwise it will provide all the given cases 


*While loop*
--> Condition is checked before the loop body executes.
--> Use while when you don't know in advance how many times the loop will execute, and you want to repeat the loop as long as a condition remains true.
--> we declare variable before starting while 

loop function 
--> for loop Condition is checked before the loop body executes, similar to while, but it has an initialization step, a condition, and an increment step all in one line
--> Use for when the number of iterations is known or easily determined before the loop starts (e.g., looping over a range or through an array).
--> if we declare variable inside starting   paranthesis then it will became local variable 
--> we can use var instead of let for making it from local to global 

do while 
--> Condition is checked after the loop body executes.
--> Use do-while when you want the loop to execute at least once before checking the condition (e.g., when a menu is presented to the user and you want to ensure the menu shows up at least once).

break --> it will stop after given condition satisfy 

continue --> continue the  output from starting to end except the desire result.
