# NPM
--> NPM is a package manager for JavaScript and is used to manage dependencies (libraries, frameworks, and tools) in Node.js projects.
-->For Running it we need to install Package globally 
--> Installing Packages:
npm install package-name
--> Installing Packages Globally:
npm install -g package-name
--> Running Scripts:
    You can define scripts in package.json and run them using:
npm run script-name
# Managing Project Dependencies:
--> package.json contains project dependencies and metadata.
--> node_modules/ stores installed packages.
# NPX
