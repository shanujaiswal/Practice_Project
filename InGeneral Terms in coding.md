# i++
--> It is the post-increment operator. It increases the value of i by 1, but returns the original value of i before the increment.
--> If i = 5, i++ will first return 5 (the original value), and then increment i to 6.

# ++i
--> It is the pre-increment operator. It increases the value of i by 1, but returns the incremented value.
--> If i = 5, ++i will first increment i to 6 and then return 6.

# i--
--> It is the post-decrement operator. It decreases the value of i by 1, but returns the original value of i before the decrement.
--> If i = 5, i-- will first return 5 (the original value), and then decrement i to 4.

# --i
--> This is the pre-decrement operator. It decreases the value of i by 1, but returns the decremented value.
--> If i = 5, --i will first decrement i to 4 and then return 4.
