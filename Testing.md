Software testing can be broadly categorized into two main types:

1. Manual Testing
Involves human testers executing test cases without automation tools.
Examples: Exploratory Testing, Ad-hoc Testing.
2. Automated Testing
Uses scripts and tools to execute test cases automatically.
Examples: Selenium, JUnit, TestNG.
# Types of Software Testing
# Functional Testing (Ensures the software meets functional requirements)
Unit Testing – Tests individual components or modules.
Integration Testing – Ensures different modules work together.
System Testing – Tests the entire system as a whole.
Regression Testing – Ensures new changes don’t break existing functionality.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) – Validates if the system meets business needs.
Smoke Testing – Basic test to check if critical features work before further testing.
Sanity Testing – Quick testing to verify bug fixes.
End-to-End Testing – Simulates real user scenarios.
Non-Functional Testing (Evaluates performance, security, usability, etc.)
Performance Testing – Checks system speed, scalability, and stability.
Load Testing – Tests system behavior under expected load.
Stress Testing – Tests system under extreme conditions.
Scalability Testing – Checks if the system can handle growth.
Security Testing – Identifies vulnerabilities.
Usability Testing – Ensures ease of use for users.
Compatibility Testing – Ensures software works on different devices, OS, and browsers.
Accessibility Testing – Ensures usability for people with disabilities.
Recovery Testing – Checks system ability to recover from failures.
Compliance Testing – Ensures software meets industry standards.
